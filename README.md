# Wordle-Bot
Reads your analysis of your wordle and tells you whether or not you beat the bot. Basically, the same as NYT's Wordle Bot but without the paywall.

## How to run locally (this is really just for me to use):
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following:
```
cd wordle-bot
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. If you have any issues, email me at snakum@uci.edu.

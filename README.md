# Wordle-Bot
Reads your analysis of your wordle and tells you whether or not you beat the bot. Basically, the same as NYT's Wordle Bot but without the paywall.

## How to run locally (this is really just for me to use):
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following:
```
cd wordle-bot
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. If you have any issues, email me at snakum@uci.edu.

## How to use the UI:
1. Just write in the actual correct word
2. Put in your guesses
3. Click "Analyze Performance"
4. Your stats card will be shown.

## Issues to work on (feel free to contribute):
* Getting the complete list of words to connect so that the bot can give recommendations to you
* the UI itself (make it look like Wordle)
